This blog explores the dynamic interplay between human and AI, highlighting the strengths and limitations of both, and envisioning a future where they coexist harmoniously.</h3>

 <p>AI lacks true intuition, gut feeling, and “human touch” in decision-making. Humans possess intuition, gut feeling, and the ability to make decisions based on hunches and emotions. AI lacks self-awareness and personal consciousness. Humans have self-awareness and can introspect on their thoughts and actions.</p>
