    <h1> My Childhood Memories Paragraph :-</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> My childhood memories are like golden time to me. I know, everyoneâ€™s childhood is so precious to them. Here I will share a few of my memories from childhood. Maybe you will find them interesting. I passed my childhood in a village near Bihar.

        My mother was my best friend at that time and she used to teach me the letters. I started my studies with a book full of pictures. I loved that book a lot and used to see the images in the book. There are several types of flowers, animals, etc pictures. Then, one day my mother took me to a school near our home.
        
        I was totally afraid because I had no idea what was going on there. Then they took me into the classroom and that was an extraordinary experience for me. I started another life called student life.  That is my most important childhood memory. It becomes an unforgotable memory to me..</p>
