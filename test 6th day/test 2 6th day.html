    <h1> Task 2</h1>
    <p> <em>It is interesting to <em>pen a few lines on the experience that I had in the examination hall</em>. I was appearing for the first time for my project exams. I read a lot on the night preceding the examination day. I revised my entire course.</em>

       <strong> Though my father warned me against the consequences of studying late in the night, unfortunately I did not pay any heed to his advice. I reached the examination hall on right time. As I was climbing the stairs, the first bell rang. I rushed to the hall and searched for the seat that was supposed to have my roll number.
        Within five minutes, all the examinees took their respective seats.</strong> My heart was beating fast. I began to feel nervous. The <em>superintendent of the examination</em> read out instructions aloud to the students. He warned the examinees against keeping any objectionable papers or notebooks in their pockets during the examination hour. However, the examinees were allowed to retain their money, bus passes and admission tickets. The superintendent also warned the candidates against using their mobile phones or any other electronic devices.

        I completed my paper and revised the entire answer sheet. While revising I corrected the mistakes that I had carelessly made. I tied all the extra-sheets to my main answer book. <strong>Then there was the last and final bell. The superintendent of the hall announced that no one should write anything from that moment onwards.</strong></p>
